1. The curve is generally linear with a slope of about .033. Therefore it can be assumed that accuracy increases with the amount of training data.
2. The data is noisier for smaller amounts of training data. This is probably due to the fact that with small amounts of data there
   is a high amount of chance associated with the accuracy of the model.
3. Even all the way up to 200 the curve isn't very smooth. There isn't significant improvement after somewhere around 40 trials.
4. Basically, the bigger C is the slower the program seems to run but the more accurate it gets.
